  1) Choose your desired venue type from the homepage.
  2) You will be presented with a voting page where you vote on restaurants in the Dallas area as either "crummy" or "yummy".
  3) Your vote will be saved in the Firebase database and will update in real-time in the rankings column and display to you how many votes that destination has received from other users like yourself.
  4) Add a comment with your facebook login to tell the world how you feel about a particular venue.
  
The Doghouse is a great way to see some of the most popular locales in Dallas. This app can easily be expanded in the future to other cities, as well as places like gyms, dog parks, hiking trails, etc.

We've all been in trouble in a relationship at one point or another, so why not make the most of it and hangout with us in the Doghouse!
